### 3. Principle


---

### Summary of Key Points:

1.  **Purpose Clarity:** Consider refining the `purpose` for greater specificity and evaluability.
2.  **`createCart` Precondition:** Clarify the "current system date is before `dateInWeek`" requirement. Is it strictly for future weeks, or does it include the current week? What about past weeks?
3.  **`addMenuToCart` Typo:** Correct `dateInWeek` to `menuDate` in the effects clause.
4.  **`addMenuToCart` Implicit `createCart` (Most Significant):** This is a strong design choice with potential for unexpected side effects and unclear error handling if `createCart`'s preconditions are not met. I recommend making `addMenuToCart` *require* an existing cart and let the application handle `createCart` separately. If you keep the implicit creation, explicitly detail what happens if `createCart` would fail.
5.  **Query Redundancy:** The `_getCartByDate` query's "valid date" precondition could likely be removed.

Overall, this is a solid concept design! Addressing these points will make it even more robust and unambiguous.
