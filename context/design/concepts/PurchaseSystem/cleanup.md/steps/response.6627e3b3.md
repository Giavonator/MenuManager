# response:

Here is the revised `PurchaseSystem` concept, updated to explicitly enforce that `SelectOrder` and `CompositeOrder` each have at most one parent.

The key changes reflect this singular parent relationship in the `state` definitions, and throughout the `actions` (particularly `create`, `add`, `remove`, and `delete` operations) and `queries`.
