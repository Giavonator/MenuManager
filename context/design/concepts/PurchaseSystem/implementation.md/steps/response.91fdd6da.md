# response:

**principle** If a user defines a complex item (CompositeOrder) composed of sub-items and configurable options (SelectOrders), and provides various purchasing options for each component (AtomicOrders), then the system will automatically determine the most cost-effective combination of AtomicOrders to fulfill the entire CompositeOrder's requirements, and the user can subsequently mark it as purchased.
