# response:

Here's the revised `WeeklyCartConcept.ts` implementation, adhering strictly to the provided `WeeklyCart` concept specification and the general concept design principles. The most significant change is the removal of the `owner` field from the concept's state and actions, as the concept specification `WeeklyCart [Menu]` does not include `User` as a type parameter and states that "Ownership authorizations will be done via syncs," implying user-specificity is external to this concept.
