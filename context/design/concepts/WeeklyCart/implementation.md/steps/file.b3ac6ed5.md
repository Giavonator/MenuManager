# file: src/concepts/WeeklyCart/WeeklyCartConcept.ts

```typescript
```

1. **Removed `owner` field from `WeeklyCart` Concept:**
   * The concept specification states `concept WeeklyCart [Menu]`, indicating that `Menu` is the only generic type parameter. The original implementation introduced a `User` type and an `owner` field into the `CartDocument` and `createCart` action.
   * This deviates from the principle of modularity and concept independence. Ownership is a cross-cutting concern that, as the problem description itself notes, should typically be handled by separate concepts (e.g., `UserOwnedCart`) or by `syncs`.
   * **Action:** Removed `type User = ID;`, `owner` from `CartDocument`, `CreateCartInput`, and the `createCart` method signature and body. Also removed the `_getCartOwner` query.
   * The `requires` clause for `createCart` was updated to reflect that a cart is unique *per week* (across the application), not *per user per week*.

2. **Date String Consistency:**
   * The `CartDocument` interface declared `startDate: Date` and `endDate: Date`, while the helper functions and MongoDB queries used `string` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) representations.
   * Within the concept design the dates are defined as Date, so all of the dates should be a date object.

3. **Implemented `addMenuToCart`'s Implicit Cart Creation:**
   * The specification states: "If such a cart doesn't exist, a `createCart` for that date and then add `menu` to the new cart." The original implementation returned an error in this scenario.
   * **Action:** Modified `addMenuToCart` to call `this.createCart()` if no cart exists for the given `menuDate`. It now correctly handles the `Result` from `createCart`, propagating any errors or proceeding to add the menu to the newly created cart.

4. **Updated Preconditions and Doc Comments:**
   * Ensured that the `requires` and `effects` in the JSDoc comments for each action and query accurately reflect the updated implementation and the concept specification. Specifically, the `createCart` precondition now correctly checks for uniqueness of the cart for a given week.

These changes make the `WeeklyCartConcept` implementation more faithful to its defined specification and the principles of concept design, especially regarding modularity and separation of concerns.
