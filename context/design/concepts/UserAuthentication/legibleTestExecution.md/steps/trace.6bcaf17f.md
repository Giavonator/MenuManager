# trace:

The `UserAuthentication` concept's `Operating Principle` is fully demonstrated through a sequence of actions and state verifications in the test case `UserAuthentication - Operating Principle`.

1. **First User Registration and Admin Status**:
   * **Action**: Jack registers (`register`) with a username and password.
   * **Verification**: The system confirms Jack's registration is successful and he can `authenticate`. Crucially, because he is the first user, his `_getIsUserAdmin` status is `true`, and the `_getNumberOfAdmins` query confirms `1` administrator. This fulfills "a person is *registered* as a User with a username and password, afterwards that person can *authenticate* as their registered user... If that person was the first user to register then they automatically are the admin".

2. **Subsequent User Registration (Non-Admin)**:
   * **Action**: Jill registers (`register`) with a distinct username and password.
   * **Verification**: Jill's registration is successful, and she can `authenticate`. However, her `_getIsUserAdmin` status is `false`, confirming she is not automatically an admin. The `_getNumberOfAdmins` count remains `1`. This demonstrates that only the first user gains admin privileges automatically and subsequent users do not.

3. **Admin Grants Administrative Privileges**:
   * **Action**: Jack (the existing admin) uses the `grantAdmin` action to elevate Jill's privileges.
   * **Verification**: The operation succeeds. Jill's `_getIsUserAdmin` status is now `true`, and `_getNumberOfAdmins` is `2`. This fulfills "Administrators can manage other users, including granting or revoking administrative privileges".

4. **Admin Deletes Account (with Minimum Admin Safeguard)**:
   * **Action**: Jack attempts to delete his own account (`deleteUser`).
   * **Verification**: The deletion succeeds. This is because Jill was granted admin privileges in the previous step, ensuring that at least one administrator (Jill) would remain in the system after Jack's deletion. The `_getListOfUsers` confirms only one user (Jill) remains, `_getNumberOfAdmins` returns `1`, and Jack can no longer `authenticate`. This fulfills "deleting users, provided a minimum number of administrators are maintained." and confirms account removal.

This trace demonstrates the core mechanics of user registration, authentication, initial admin assignment, admin privilege management, and the safe deletion of users while upholding the minimum admin count, thereby covering the complete `Operating Principle` of the `UserAuthentication` concept.
