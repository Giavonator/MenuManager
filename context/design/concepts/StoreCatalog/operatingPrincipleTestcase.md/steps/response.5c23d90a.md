# response:

To dynamically handle errors when accessing action/query results in the test file, we'll introduce a set of specialized assertion helpers. The core issue is that many concept methods return a union type, e.g., `{ item: ID } | { error: string }`, and TypeScript prevents direct access to `item` without a type guard.

We'll use the following approach:

1. **Refactor `assertAndLog`**: The existing `assertAndLog` helper will be renamed to `assertEqualsAndLog` and simplified to only perform direct value comparisons *after* the success/error state has been determined.
2. **Introduce `assertActionSuccess` and `assertActionError`**: These helpers will be used for actions that return a single object (or `Empty`) or an error object. They will explicitly check for the presence of an `error` property and handle logging/throwing accordingly.
3. **Introduce `assertQuerySuccess` and `assertQueryError`**: These helpers will be used for queries. Since queries *always* return an array (even for single results or errors, as per the concept design documentation, e.g., `[{ item: ID }]` or `[{ error: "..." }]`), these functions will specifically handle the array structure.
4. **Update `StoreCatalogConcept.test.ts`**: All existing assertions will be updated to use these new, more specific helpers, removing the need for explicit type guards (`"prop" in result`) and `as` type assertions within the test logic.

This approach will make the tests more robust, readable, and type-safe, explicitly declaring whether a success or an error is expected at each assertion point.

Here's the updated `StoreCatalogConcept.ts` reflecting the three requested changes (add `addPurchaseOptionOrder`, `addItemOrder`, and update comments):
