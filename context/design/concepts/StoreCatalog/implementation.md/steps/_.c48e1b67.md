# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

The LLM prompt must be structured so that the LLM returns ONLY a JSON that we are able to parse. This way we can parse the output and integrate it to the rest of the software.

You can you use llm defined functions within gemini-llm.ts using:

```typescript
import { freshID } from "@utils/database.ts";
```
