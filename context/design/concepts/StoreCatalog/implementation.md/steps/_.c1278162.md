# Inputs/Outputs Specification

As explained above arguments and results must be defined as dictionaries. The input/output types must be defined at the top of the implementation file, this way we can simplify the actions and queries below.

For queries, remember that error output is a dictionary of error to the string error message: `{error: "the error message"}`. Define the QueryOutput in the same format as the action, but when returing an error in a query return it as `{error: "the error message"}` NOT an array.
