# Inputs/Outputs Specification

As explained above arguments and results must be defined as dictionaries. The input/output types must be defined at the top of the implementation file, this way we can simplify the actions and queries below.

For queries, remember that error output is a dictionary of error to the string error message: `{error: "the error message"}`. Do not try to return an array of ErrorType.
