# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

## CookBook

**concept** CookBook \[User]

**purpose** Store and manage definitions of recipes, including their ingredients, instructions, and ownership, enabling reuse and duplication for chefs.

**principle** A chef `createRecipe` for "Spicy Pasta". They `addRecipeIngredient` for pasta, tomatoes, and spices. After defining all instructions and serving details via `updateRecipe`, they `designateOwner` themselves. Another chef finds "Spicy Pasta", `duplicateRecipe` a new recipe as "Mild Pasta" under their ownership, and `updateRecipe`/`updateRecipeIngredient` to change the recipe more to their liking.

**state**\
  a set of Recipe with\
    a name String\
    an instructions String\
    a servingQuantity Int\
    a dishType String\
    an owner User\
