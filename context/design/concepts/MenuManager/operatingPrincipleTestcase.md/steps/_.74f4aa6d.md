# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

The LLM prompt must be structured so that the LLM returns ONLY a JSON that we are able to parse. This way we can parse the output and integrate it to the rest of the software.

You can you use llm defined functions within gemini-llm.ts using:

```typescript
import { freshID } from "@utils/database.ts";
```
