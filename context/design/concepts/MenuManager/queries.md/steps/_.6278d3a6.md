# MenuManager (AI Augmentation)

**concept** Menu \[User, Administrator]

**purpose** creating recipes for full course meals

**principle** A friendly chef embarks on their journey of creating a delicious five course menu with amazing different recipes. They *createMenu* with the specific date of the event and starts by adding their first recipe. Luckily a NEW LLM feature has been added that allows the chef to directly *pullRecipeFromWebsite* using website URL. The LLM is able to parse a good amount of the recipe, but the chef must *updateRecipeIngredient* and *updateRecipe* for a couple things. Unfortunately for the chefs second recipe they have it on paper, but they are still able to enter it in manually. They start by adding their second recipe: *createRecipe*. As they are about to *updateRecipeIngredient* they realize that pumpernickel is not registered as an item they've cooked with before. They then *enterItem* into the system with appropriate price and quantity information, allowing them to *updateRecipeIngredient* to their recipe with the appropriate amount of the ingredient they want have for their recipe. They continue finishing up the recipe when they realize they put the wrong recipe name, and change it via *updateRecipe*. A couple days later once our chef is done adding recipes to their menu, the administrator comes in and sees they added the new pumpernickel ingredient. The administrator figures out what the cost and where to purchase the item and *updateItem* in the system. Finally, the menu is all done and confirmed!
