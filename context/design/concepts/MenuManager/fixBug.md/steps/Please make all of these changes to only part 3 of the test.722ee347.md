# Please make all of these changes to only part 3 of the test: 1. Seperate Sub-step 3.2 w/ update + verification into Sub-step 3.2 w/ update and Sub-step 3.3 w/ verification. 2. Do not assume that the LLM actually parses anything appropriately. The LLM is used for us to try reaching closer to being done, but that doesn't mean it has to be good. Only verify that it returned a parseable JSON object with valid entries.
