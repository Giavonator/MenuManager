# The above suggestion did not fix the issue. When looking at the code I can clearly see that ing has not been defined in the scope of that for loop. Please figure out what ingredient it is actually refering to and use that ingredient. THE BUG IS IN MenuManagerConcept.test.ts NOT THE ACTUALY IMPLEMENTATION.
