# The code is problematic as the `typeof flourResult !== "string" && "item" in (flourResult as any)` is returning false in our test case 2.1. It is faililng though because flourResult is a string of the item's id. What we actually need here is that the check verifies that it isn't an error, that way we can cast it as the id. Please update this case for all instances of assertAndLog verifying registerItemAndStorePrice. Only update MenuManagerConcept.test.ts.
