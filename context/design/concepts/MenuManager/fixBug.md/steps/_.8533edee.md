# The code is problematic as the `!("error" in (flourResult as { item: ID } | { error: string }))` is returning false in our test case 2.1. It is failing because the result is actually both a string for the error or the item id. We can verify though that it is an ID as all IDs are in this form: 0199ee46-c050-72a3-827e-4b2577c12a33. Specifically length, postitioning of '-' and all lowercase or numbers. Please update the check to be this instead.
