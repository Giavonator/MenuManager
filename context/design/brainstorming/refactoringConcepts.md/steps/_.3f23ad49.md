# MenuManager (AI Augmentation)

**concept** Menu \[User]

**purpose** creating recipes for full course meals

**principle** A friendly chef embarks on their journey of creating a delicious five course menu with amazing different recipes. They *createMenu* with the specific date of the event and starts by adding their first recipe. Creating their first recipe: *createRecipe*. As they are adding ingredients they realize that most of them haven't been used before. They then *enterItem* into the system with appropriate price and quantity information for each new ingredient, allowing them to *updateRecipeIngredient* to their recipe with the appropriate amount of the ingredient they want have for their recipe. They continue finishing up the recipe with additional *updateRecipeIngredient* when they realize they put the wrong recipe name, and change it via *updateRecipe*. Luckily a NEW LLM feature has been added that allows the chef to directly *pullRecipeFromWebsite* using website URL. The LLM is able to parse a good amount of the recipe, but the chef must *updateRecipeIngredient* and *updateRecipe* for a couple things. If the LLM is also unable to add a couple items, thats okay, the chef will simply *updateRecipeIngredient* to add new ingredients. Unfortunately for the chefs second recipe they have it on paper, but they are still able to enter it in manually. A couple days later once our chef is done adding recipes to their menu, the administrator comes in and sees they added the new pumpernickel ingredient. The administrator figures out what the cost and where to purchase the item and *updateItem* in the system. Finally, the menu is all done and confirmed!

I've realized that having one very large concept does not work, and is a pain to implement and test. We would like to refactor the MenuManager concept into five seperate concepts: StoreCatalog, CookBook, FrenchMeal, ShoppingCart, PurchaseSystem. Instead of having one big concept, instead these basic concepts will be synchronized together to perform what the previous MenuManger was doing. Your goal is to use the old MenuManager along with the additional notes below, and write a concept file for each of the new concepts.

StoreCatalog: Should be the set of Item from MenuManager. Changes to be made:

1. Each Item should have a set of PurchaseAmount, where each PurchaseAmount has a quantity (Ex. 3) and a units ("lbs"). That way we can store different sizes of things that we would be able to purchase.

FrenchMeal: Should contain the set of Recipe, but don't include cost for the recipe. Instead for each recipe have an associated 'Order' that will be defined in PurchaseSystem. Whenever a change happens to the recipe, it will be synchronously mapped to that recipes order. Changes to be made to the recipes:

1. Recipe should no longer be tied to a Menu within its scope. Remove menu from all updateRecipe and createRecipe.
2. Creating a recipe should now only require a recipe name. The rest should be updated using updateRecipe.
3. Create an designateOwner action that asignes a User as the owner to a recipe. It must require that the recipe doesn't already have an owner.
4. Create duplicateRecipe that takes in a recipe ID and a user ID, which will duplicate the recipe and have the new user own that duplicated recipe.
5. Modify pullRecipeFromWebsite to addCopiedIngredients that should instead take in a String that would be the copy and pasting of all the ingredients from the user. This way the LLM can parse through directly the ingredients (which is most of the work), and then add them to the Recipe. This should also return the set of ingredients that were not added to the recipe. That way we are able to inform the user of ones that were forgotten.

FrenchMeal: This should be the set of Menu that have a set of Recipe, but only Recipe ID. As this is its own concept now the Menu cannot see everything that is within the Recipe, but rather is more just like a list of Recipe. The Menu should no longer have a cost, but instead an associated 'Order' that will be defined in PurchaseSystem. Changes to he made to menus:

1. Create an addRecipe action that associated a recipe ID with the Menu. The menu owner does not need to own the recipe. This addRecipe should only take the Recipe ID and a scaling for that Recipe.
2. Create changeRecipeScaling action that can change the scaling of a Recipe within the Menu.
3. Each Menu should have stored the ID of its respective Order.

ShoppingCart: This should be the set of Cart that contain the set of Menu for a specific week. It should have the startDate, endDate, set of Menu, and the ID for its respective Order.

1. List of actions should be createCart, addMenuToCart, removeMenuFromCart.

PurchaseSystem: Really the only new concept, and is replacing the set of Cart. Instead we should now have a set of Order that contain: a set of SubOrder, a set of ParentOrder, a cost Float, a purchased Flag. The actions for this concept should be: createOrder, addSubOrder, addParentOrder, removeSubOrder, removeParentOrder, marOrderAsPurchased.

***

You currently have a monolithic `MenuManager` concept. Your goal is to refactor its functionality into five distinct, modular concepts: `StoreCatalog`, `CookBook`, `MenuCollection`, `ShoppingCart`, and `PurchaseSystem`. These new concepts should be independent and then connected via explicit `synchronizations` to replicate the overall functionality of the original `MenuManager`.

For each new concept, you should provide its complete specification, including:

* **`concept`**: Name and any type parameters.
* **`purpose`**: A concise, need-focused, specific, and evaluable statement.
* **`principle`**: An archetypal scenario demonstrating how the concept fulfills its purpose.
* **`state`**: A data model representing the concept's persistent information, clearly defining relationships and properties.
* **`actions`**: A set of user-facing and system actions with their input arguments, results, preconditions (`requires`), and postconditions (`effects`).
* **`queries`**: A set of explicit queries for retrieving information from the concept's state.

Below are the detailed requirements and specific changes for each concept. Please pay close attention to the relationships between concepts and how functionality is distributed to ensure clear separation of concerns.

***

\*\*\* General Clarifications:

1. **Entity IDs:** `Recipe`, `Menu`, `Item`, `Cart`, `Order` are opaque entity types (like `User` in the original prompt).
2. **Concept Type Parameters:** The original `MenuManager` was `Menu [User]`. For each of the concepts if it needs the opaque type `Recipe` or `Menu` then it should include it in the same manner as for the `MenuManager`.

***

\*\*\* Concept 1: StoreCatalog

This concept should manage the master list of all purchasable items and their purchasing options.

* **Relationship to `MenuManager`:** This concept will replace the `a set of Item` part of the original `MenuManager`'s state.
* **State Changes:**
  * An `Item` should no longer have `quantity` or `units` directly.
  * Instead, each `Item` must have a **set of `PurchaseOption`s**. Each `PurchaseOption` should include:
    * `quantity`: A `Float` representing the purchasable amount (e.g., `3.0`).
    * `units`: A `String` (e.g., "lbs", "oz", "count").
    * `price`: A `Float` for the cost of this specific `PurchaseOption`.
    * `store`: A `String` indicating where this `PurchaseOption` can be bought.
  * An `Item` should retain its `Set of String names` (for aliases like 'pepper', 'ground pepper') and its `confirmed Bool` flag.
* **Actions:**
  * Consolidate and adapt the item-related actions from `MenuManager` to fit the new `PurchaseOption` structure. Specifically, define actions for:
    * `createItem`: To add a new `Item` to the catalog. It should initially have no `PurchaseOption`s and be `unconfirmed`.
    * `addPurchaseOption`: To add a specific `PurchaseOption` (quantity, units, price, store) to an existing `Item`.
    * `updatePurchaseOption`: To modify an existing `PurchaseOption`'s quantity, units, price, or store.
    * `removeItemName` and `addItemName`: For managing aliases.
    * `confirmItem`: An action (likely restricted to an administrator) to mark an `Item` as confirmed.
  * **Clarification:** Should there be an action to remove a `PurchaseOption` from an `Item`?
* **Queries:** Define queries to retrieve items, their purchase options, and other relevant item-specific information.

***

\*\*\* Concept 2: CookBook

This concept should manage the repository of recipes. It focuses purely on recipe definition, independent of specific menus or pricing.

* **Suggested Name:** Renamed from "FrenchMeal" (for recipes) to avoid confusion.
* **Relationship to `MenuManager`:** This replaces the `a set of Recipe` part of the original `MenuManager` state, but as a top-level entity, not nested under `Menu`.
* **State Changes:**
  * A `Recipe` should include: `name String`, `instructions String`, `servingQuantity Int`, `scalingFactor Float`, `dishType String`.
  * A `Recipe` **must not** include `dishPrice Float` or any direct cost information.
  * A `Recipe` should *no longer* store the `owner User` directly. Ownership will be managed by the `designateOwner` action.
  * A `Recipe` must also store its ingredients. An ingredient entry within a recipe should be a reference to an `Item` from the `StoreCatalog` and the `amount Int` specific to that recipe.
* **Actions:**
  * `createRecipe (name: String)`: Creates a new recipe with only a name. Other details (instructions, serving quantity, etc.) are set via `updateRecipe` actions. It should not assign an owner.
  * `updateRecipe (recipe: Recipe, ...)`: Overloaded actions to update `instructions`, `servingQuantity`, `scalingFactor` (ensure consistent type, Float), `dishType`, `name`.
  * `designateOwner (recipe: Recipe, user: User)`: Assigns a `User` as the owner of a recipe. Requires the recipe to not already have an owner.
  * `duplicateRecipe (recipe: Recipe, user: User)`: Duplicates an existing recipe, assigning the new copy to the specified `user`. All ingredients and other properties should be copied.
    * **Clarification:** What if the target `user` already owns a recipe with the same name? Should it fail, or append a suffix (e.g., " (Copy)")?
  * `addRecipeIngredient (recipe: Recipe, item: Item, amount: Int)`: Adds or updates an ingredient (`Item` reference from `StoreCatalog` with its `amount`) to a recipe.
  * `removeRecipeIngredient (recipe: Recipe, item: Item)`: Removes an ingredient from a recipe.
  * `addCopiedIngredients (recipe: Recipe, ingredientText: String)`: This replaces the `pullRecipeFromWebsite` action's ingredient parsing functionality. It takes a raw string of ingredients, uses an internal LLM to parse them, and attempts to map them to existing `Item`s in `StoreCatalog`.
    * **Effect:** Add parsed ingredients to the recipe. Return a `Set of String` containing any parsed ingredient names that could *not* be mapped to an `Item` in `StoreCatalog`.
    * **Clarification:** Does `addCopiedIngredients` handle parsing *only* ingredients, or other recipe details like instructions or name as well? For this exercise, assume it focuses *only* on ingredients.
* **Queries:** Define queries for retrieving recipes, their details, and their ingredient lists.

***

\*\*\* Concept 3: MenuCollection

This concept should manage the composition of menus, which are collections of recipes with specific scaling. It no longer handles costs directly.

* **Suggested Name:** Renamed from "FrenchMeal" (for menus) to avoid confusion.
* **Relationship to `MenuManager`:** This replaces the `a set of Menu` part of the original `MenuManager` state.
* **State Changes:**
  * A `Menu` should include: `name String`, `date String`, `owner User`.
  * A `Menu` **must not** include `menuCost Float`.
  * A `Menu` should store a **set of `MenuRecipe` entries**. Each `MenuRecipe` should be:
    * A reference to a `RecipeID` (from `CookBook`).
    * A `scalingFactor Float` specific to this recipe within this menu.
  * Each `Menu` should store an `OrderID` (from `PurchaseSystem`), representing the aggregated order for this menu.
* **Actions:**
  * `createMenu (name: String, date: String, owner: User)`: Creates a new, empty menu owned by the specified user.
  * `updateMenu (menu: Menu, name: String)` and `updateMenu (menu: Menu, date: String)`: Actions to update menu attributes.
  * `addRecipe (menu: Menu, recipe: RecipeID, scalingFactor: Float)`: Associates a `RecipeID` (from `CookBook`) with the `Menu` and defines its `scalingFactor` within that menu. The menu owner does not need to own the recipe.
  * `removeRecipe (menu: Menu, recipe: RecipeID)`: Removes a `RecipeID` from the `Menu`.
  * `changeRecipeScaling (menu: Menu, recipe: RecipeID, newScalingFactor: Float)`: Modifies the scaling factor of a specific `RecipeID` within the `Menu`.
* **Queries:** Define queries to retrieve menus, the recipes within them, and their scaling factors.

***

\*\*\* Concept 4: ShoppingCart

This concept manages weekly shopping carts, which are collections of menus for a specific period. It focuses on scheduling and grouping menus, deferring detailed cost management to `PurchaseSystem`.

* **Relationship to `MenuManager`:** This replaces the `a set of Cart` part of the original `MenuManager` state.
* **State Changes:**
  * A `Cart` should include: `startDate String`, `endDate String` (implicitly derived from `startDate`).
  * A `Cart` should store a **set of `MenuID`s** (from `MenuCollection`).
  * A `Cart` **must not** include `weeklyCost Float`.
  * Each `Cart` should store an `OrderID` (from `PurchaseSystem`), representing the aggregated order for this cart.
* **Actions:**
  * `createCart (startDate: String, owner: User)`: Creates an empty cart with a given `startDate`.
    * **Requires:** `startDate` must be a Sunday. No other cart exists for this `owner` with this `startDate`.
    * **Effects:** `endDate` is set to the Friday of the same week. The cart is owned by the specified `user`.
  * `addMenuToCart (cart: Cart, menu: MenuID)`: Adds a `MenuID` (from `MenuCollection`) to the `Cart`.
    * **Requires:** The `Menu` referenced by `MenuID` must have a `date` that falls within the `cart`'s `startDate` and `endDate`. The `cart` must not already contain a menu for that specific date.
  * `removeMenuFromCart (cart: Cart, menu: MenuID)`: Removes a `MenuID` from the `Cart`.
* **Queries:** Define queries to retrieve carts, and the menus associated with them.
* **Clarification:** Should a `Cart` be owned by a `User`? (Implied by `owner: User` in `createCart` action).

***

\*\*\* Concept 5: PurchaseSystem

This is a new concept responsible for managing and aggregating orders, costs, and purchase status. It forms the financial backbone, consolidating cost information from various sources (recipes, menus, carts).

* **Relationship to `MenuManager`:** This replaces the implicit cost calculation and item purchasing aspects of `MenuManager`'s `Cart`.
* **State Changes:**
  * A `set of Order` entities. Each `Order` should include:
    * `cost`: A `Float` representing the total calculated cost.
    * `purchased`: A `Bool` flag indicating if the order has been finalized.
    * `owner`: A `User` who owns this order.
    * `itemQuantities`: A `Map of ItemID to Float` representing the aggregated quantity of each `ItemID` (from `StoreCatalog`) needed for this order.
    * `associatedEntityID`: An opaque `ID` (e.g., `RecipeID`, `MenuID`, `CartID`) indicating what this order directly represents.
    * `subOrders`: A `Set of OrderID`s, representing orders whose costs and items are aggregated into this one.
    * `parentOrders`: A `Set of OrderID`s, representing orders that aggregate this one.
* **Actions:**
  * `createOrder (owner: User, associatedEntityID: ID)`: Creates a new order.
    * **Clarification:** How is the initial `cost` and `itemQuantities` determined? Does it calculate based on the `associatedEntityID` (e.g., if `associatedEntityID` is a `RecipeID`, it calculates ingredient costs; if it's a `MenuID`, it aggregates recipe orders)?
  * `addSubOrder (parentOrder: Order, subOrder: Order)`: Links a `subOrder` to a `parentOrder`, aggregating its cost and item quantities into the `parentOrder`.
  * `removeSubOrder (parentOrder: Order, subOrder: Order)`: Unlinks a `subOrder`, adjusting the `parentOrder`'s cost and item quantities.
  * `markOrderAsPurchased (order: Order)`: Sets the `purchased` flag to `true`.
  * **Clarification:** Should there be actions to update the item quantities within an `Order` directly, or is this solely driven by `addSubOrder`/`removeSubOrder` and potentially synchronizations from `CookBook` and `MenuCollection` when recipes/menus change?
* **Queries:** Define queries for retrieving orders, their costs, their contained items, and their purchase status.
