# response:

The existing test cases effectively cover the core operating principle, username uniqueness, and password management. A key area that could be further reinforced, particularly regarding admin management, is the edge case where:

1. An attempt is made to **delete the last remaining administrator**. The concept explicitly prevents this.
2. An attempt is made to **grant admin privileges to a user who is already an admin**. The concept handles this with an error message, ensuring idempotency and clear feedback.

Let's add a new test case for these "Admin Management Edge Cases."
